\section{Preface}
The following is a set of personal notes that have been taken during the lecture given by dr Joachim Jelisiejew as part of a WS2019/2020 course in commutative algebra (\textit{Algebra przemienna}) at the faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics, University of Warsaw.

The text contains errors of nature typographical and factual, introduced due to imperfect reproduction of the lecture's contents, as well as by way of further additions. Some of those were corrected, owing to the invaluable assistance of instructors and other students.
