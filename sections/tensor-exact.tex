\section{Exactness}

\begin{df}
  Let $M_i$ be $A$-modules, $i = 1, 2, 3$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The sequence
    \[ M_1 \xto{f_1} M_2 \xto{f_2} M_3\]
    is exact if
    \[ \im f_1 = \ker f_2.\]
  \item The sequence
    \[ M_1 \xto{f_1} M_2 \xto{f_2} M_3 \to 0\]
    is exact if and only if
    \[ M_1 \to M_2 \to M_3\]
    is exact and $f_2$ is surjective.
  \item The sequence
    \[ 0 \to M_1 \xto{f_1} M_2 \xto{f_2} M_3 \to 0\]
    is a short exact sequence if:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $f_1$ is injective,
    \item $\im f_1 = \ker f_2$,
    \item $f_2$ is surjective.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{df}

\begin{prop}[right-exactness of the tensor product]
  \label{tensor-right-exact}
  For all exact sequences
  \[ M_1 \xto{f_1} M_2 \xto{f_2} M_3 \to 0\]
  and for all $N \in \mod{A}$, the induced sequence
  \[ M_1 \tensor_A N \xto{f_1 \tensor_A \id} M_2 \tensor_A N \xto{f_2 \tensor \id} M_3 \tensor N \to 0\]
  is exact.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  First, we need to check that
  \[ M_2 \tensor_A N \to M_3 \tensor_A N\]
  is ``onto''. This is checked on elements: $M_3 \tensor_A N$ is generated by elements of the form
  \[ m_3 \tensor n \quad \text{such that} \quad m_3 \in M_3, n \in N.\]
  The claim then follows by surjectivity of $f_2$ itself.

  Exactness in the middle means that
  \[ M_2 \tensor N / {(f_1 \tensor \id)(M_1 \tensor N)} \to M_3 \tensor N\]
  is an isomorphism. We already checked that it is ``onto''; now we need to know that there exists a section, that is, a one-sided inverse.

  Have
  \[ M_2 /{f_1(M_1)} \cong M_3 \times N \to M_2 \tensor_A N /{(f_1 \tensor \id)(M_1 \tensor_A N)} \text{ via } (m_3, n) \mapsto \overline{m_2 \tensor n}.\]
  This is bilinear if it is well-defined.
  % TODO well-defined.
  Hence, it yields a  map
  \[ s \colon M_3 \tensor_A N \to M_2 \tensor N\]
  and indeed, the equality
  \[ s \circ \pi = \id_{M_3 \tensor N}\]
  holds, and so $\pi$ is injective and further, an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{note}
  We have shown that
  \[M_3 \cong M_2 /{f_1(M_1)}.\]
  Hence, we get
  \[ M_2 / {(f_1(M_1)} \tensor N \cong M_2 \tensor_A N /{(f_1(M_1) \tensor_A N)}.\]
\end{note}

\begin{example}
  $A /{I} \tensor_A N \cong N /{IN}$.
\end{example}
And in fact, quotients and localizations of modules can be computed by means of the tensor product.

\begin{note}
  The notions of right-exactness as defined above in \cref{tensor-right-exact} coincide with the preserving of colimits. The definition of \cref{tensor-right-exact} is valid in the case of preadditive categories.
