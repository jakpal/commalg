\section{Conventions}


Rings will be understood to be commutative, associative, unitary; the ring "0=1" is considered a ring. Ring homomorphism are assumed to preserve the unit.

$k$ will denote a field, $\bar k$ its algebraic closure. Typically, this field will be $\complex$ - the complex numbers - but not always.

Ideals will be denoted by $I$ and $J$. Ideals satisfying additional properties will be written in \textfrak{fraktur} and named distinctly: prime ideals are $\mathfrak p$, $\mathfrak q$; maximal ideals, $\mathfrak m$, $\mathfrak n$.
