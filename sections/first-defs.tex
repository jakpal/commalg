\section{First definitions}

\begin{df}
Let $A$ be a ring. Then an $A$-algebra is a ring $B$ together with a fixed homomorphism $A \to B$. This homomorphism is called the structural homomorphism.

The homomorphism is presumed to preserve 1.
\end{df}

\begin{df}
  Le $A$ be a ring. A homomorphism of $A$-algebras is a ring homomorphism commuting with the structural maps, that is, if $\phi: A \to B$, $\psi: A \to C$ are $A$-algebras, then a ring homomorphism $f:B \to C$ is an algebra homomorphism if $\psi = f \circ \phi$.
\end{df}

\begin{example}
  $f: \complex \to \complex$ is given by $z \mapsto \bar z$ (the complex conjugation). Here:
\begin{itemize}
\item f is a ring homomorphism
\item f is a real algebra homomorphism
\item f is not a complex algebra homomorphism
\end{itemize}
The intuition for this is: we wish to see no ``dirty tricks'' with respect to $A$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  In the case
  \[ B = \complex [x] / {I}, \enspace C = \complex [y] / {J},\]
  the quotient map $B \to C$ is a complex algebra homomorphism.
\end{example}

\begin{df}
\mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A ring $A$ is a domain if
  \[\forall a,b \in A \enspace ( ab = 0 \implies a = 0 \lor b = 0. )\]
\item An ideal $I$ in a ring $B$ is prime if $B/{I}$ is a domain.
\item A ring $A$ is a field if
  \[\forall 0 \neq a \in A \enspace \exists b \in A \enspace ab = 1,\] that is, every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.
\item An ideal $I$ in a ring $B$ is maximal if $B/{I}$ is a field.
\end{enumerate}
\end{df}
